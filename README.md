Hi! I developed a solitaire app to play solitaire online. If you know how to play, just give it a try!

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install
    
Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run serve
and you will see the project in your browser!
